Project Name: 

Automation Project with Selenium WebDriver, Java, and Cucumber
This project is an automation solution developed using Selenium WebDriver, Java, and Cucumber. 
The purpose of this project is to automate the registration process by reading data from a CSV file. 
The registration process involves validating the input data, such as the first name and last name with capital letters only, unique email addresses
, and valid mobile numbers. Additionally, 
the project verifies the successful message after the registration process.



Prerequisites:

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following components set up on your system:
1) Java Development Kit (JDK): Install JDK 8 or above from the official Oracle website or through package managers like Homebrew (for Windows).
2) Selenium WebDriver: Download and configure the Selenium WebDriver Java libraries. You can obtain the libraries from the Selenium official website or through 
a dependency management tool like Maven.
3) Cucumber: Set up Cucumber to enable the execution of BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) scenarios. Cucumber requires dependencies 
 such as Cucumber-Java and Cucumber-JUnit.
4) Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose an IDE of your preference, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code, 
 and ensure that it is properly installed and configured.
 
 
 Getting Started :
 
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1) Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2) Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3) Resolve the project dependencies by either using Maven or configuring the build path in your IDE.
4) Update the CSV file (data.csv) located in the project's resources directory with the desired registration data. 
Ensure that the data follows the required format, such as capital letters for the first and last names and unique email addresses.
5) Run the Cucumber runner class CucumberRunner.java to execute the automation tests.
